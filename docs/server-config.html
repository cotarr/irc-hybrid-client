        <div class="install-section-title">Initial IRC Server Configuration</div>
        <p>
          The first time the web server is started, an empty IRC server list will be created 
          automatically as "servers.json" in the base folder of the repository.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon the first login to the web page at `/irc/webclient.html`, the 
          browser will be automatically redirected to the server list editor page.
          The IRC server edit form includes instructions showing how to add 
          new IRC servers.
        </p>

        <div class="install-section-title">Optional Manual Configuration</div>
        <p>
          There are two ways to edit the list of IRC server definitions, using 
          the browser web page or use of a text editor to modify the configuration file directly.
          This first section will focus on the use of the web page editor. 
          The secpmd sectopm at the bottom of this page includes instructions 
          related to the manual edit method.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also possible to globally disable the web page server list editor by setting 
          &quot;disableServerListEditor:true&quot; in the credentials.json file 
          or setting the environment variable &quot;IRC_DISABLE_LIST_EDITOR=true&quot;
          This may be useful if the IRC client is to be restricted to one IRC network.
          In the case where the editor has been disabled, the manual edit method must be used.
        </p>
        <div class="install-section-title">Invoking the editor</div>
        <p>
          The server list editor is external to the IRC web client web page. 
          The editor operates fully independent from chatting with the IRC client.
          The web page editor may be used to view IRC server definitions as read-only
          while connected to the IRC network. However, it is necessary to disconnect 
          from the IRC network while making changes.
        </p>

        <div class="home-detail">
          <div class="image-text">
            <p>
              The server list editor web page can be invoked by clicking the [Edit Server List]
              button located on the &quot;IRC Controls&quot; panel of the IRC web client.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alternately, the page can be loaded by entering &quot;/irc/serverlist.html&quot;
              into the browser address bar. 
              If you receive a 403 Forbidden error, visit &quot;/irc/webclient.html&quot; first
              to enter username and password.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both the IRC client and the server list may be open concurrently, 
              but the client must be disconnected from the IRC network to edit the list.

        <div class="install-section-title">Managing the List</div>
        <p>
          The server list editor web page will present the current list of IRC server definitions in table format.
          The list is loaded from the servers.json file in the base folder of the web server.
          The left most column indicates the server index position in the list.
          The server definition with the lowest index number that is not disabled will be
          the default definition that will be selected when the application is started.
          In the far right column, [move-up] buttons may be used to re-order the list.
        </p>
        <p>
          The disable checkbox is used to prevent an individual IRC server definition from 
          being selected using the [Next], [Prev] buttons in the web client.
          Disabled IRC server definitions are excluded from automatic server rotation when connections fail.
          The disabled checkbox is the only property that may be modified 
          from within in the server list table.
        </p>
        <p>
          The &quot;group&quot; column shows an integer group number. 
          Groups are used to configure and define a common group of IRC server definitions.
          In the event of an IRC server network connection failures, 
          different IRC servers within a common group number can be 
          automatically rotated to other servers in the group.
          Group 0 is reserved for stand alone servers.
          A rotation group is defined when the group number is 1 or greater . 
          If more than two server in a group are not disabled and both have the 
          reconnect property enabled, then upon disconnect, the client will 
          automatically rotate IRC server definitions within a server group.
        </p>
        <p>
          The [Return to IRC Client] button is a hyper-link back to the IRC client URL at /irc/webclient.html.
        </p>
        <p>
          The [Copy] button will duplicate the associated IRC server definition and add the 
          copy to the bottom of the list.
        </p><p>
          The [Delete] button will remove the associated IRC server from the list.
        </p><p>
          The [Edit] button will open a user input form as shown below in the next section.
          The [Create New IRC Server] button will open the same form populated with some default values.

        <p>
          The [Show all columns] button will expand the table to that all IRC server properties are displayed 
          with IRC server definitions in a single table.
          Clicking the button a second time will collapse the table to it's original small size.

          Data is entered into a simple HTML form.  
          After editing is complete, the [Save] button will write the changes to the database file 
          on the web server. The [Cancel] button will leave the data unchanged.
        </p>
        <p>
          The disable/hide checkbox is used to prevent an individual server from 
          being selected using the [Next], [Prev] buttons in the web client.
        </p>
        <p>
          The &quot;Server Rotation Group Number&quot; field shows an integer group number. 
          Groups are used to configure and define a common group of IRC server definitions.
          In the event of IRC server network connection failures, 
          different IRC servers within a common group number can be 
          automatically rotated to other servers in the group.
          Group 0 is reserved for stand alone servers.
          A rotation group is defined when the group number is 1 or greater . 
          If more than two server in a group are not disabled and both have the 
          Auto Reconnect property enabled, then upon disconnect, the client will 
          automatically rotate IRC server definitions within a server group.
        </p>        
        <p>
          The &quot;Label&quot; is used to provide a descriptive name for an IRC server definition.
          The Label is not otherwise used, and it may contain any arbitrary string values.
          If you are using a small screen smartphone, it is best to keep the Label short.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the reconnect checkbox is checked, after disconnect, the IRC
          client will attempt to reconnect to IRC. For the first try, it will use 
          the existing server definition and existing nickname. 
          In the case where first reconnect 
          attempt using the same IRC server and nickname fails, if additional 
          IRC servers have been defined within a Group, other IRC server 
          definitions will be tried. Upon reconnect, it will attempt to 
          re-join up to 5 channels that were open at the time of disconnection. 
          This feature does not support channel passwords.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this time there are no provisions to configure a server to 
          auto-connect to IRC on startup. There is no provision 
          to auto-join channels on startup

              When the log checkbox is checked, the raw IRC messages from the IRC server
              are written the file &quot;irc.log&quot; located in the logs folder.
              Caution should be used as logging of passwords or other bot credentials
              may occur. Some filters are included to redact common password syntax
              before writing to the log, but the list may not include all possibilities.
              This is really intended for debugging. There are obvious privacy concerns here.
               It is recommended to leave this set to false.

              The checkbox for socks5 proxy will enable this IRC server definition to use the 
              programs global socks5 configuration for the IRC connection.
              This setting is ignored when socks5 proxy is disabled or has 
              not been configured in the web server settings.
              Socks5 settings must be configured globally in the credentials.json file 
              or with environment variables as described in the 
              <a href="login-config.html">login config</a> section.

              If IRC server password field is optional.
              It may used for IRC servers that require a password in order to connect to the IRC network.
              The password is a write-only field and the current value may not be viewed from 
              the web page for security reasons.
              Security note: The IRC server password is stored in plain text in 
              the servers.json file, and it may be viewed there.

            <p>
              SASL authorization is optional.
              IRC server SASL authorization was added specifically for use with libera.chat
              and has not been tested on any other IRC networks.
              If both SASL username and password contain valid string values,
              the SASL username and SASL password will be sent to the IRC server during the initial
              connection. To disable, leave these values blank. 
              In the event of a login failure, a standard IRC connection will be
              attempted without SASL. The only mechanism supported at this time is PLAIN.
              The SASL password is a write-only field and the current value may not 
              be viewed from the web page for security reasons.
              Security note: The SASL password is stored in plain text in the

              If an optional alternate nickname is specified, it will be tried when the primary 
              nickname is not available. If the nickname recovery checkbox is checked, should the 
              primary nickname become available while the user is logged in to IRC with the alternate 
              nickname, automatic recovery of the primary nickname will be attempted.

        <p>
          When the &quot;logging&quot; property is set to true, IRC messages 
          are written to the &quot;logs/irc.log&quot; file located with the backend web server.
          There are no provisions for logging on the local machine where
          the web browser is open.
          All messages from the IRC server are logged in raw message format.
          The program does not include log file pruning,
          so please watch the size of your log files as they can become quite large.
          Caution should be used as logging of passwords or other bot credentials
          may occur.
          This is really intended for debugging. It is recommended to leave
          this set to false.

        <div class="install-section-title">4 - IRC User Information</div>
        <p>
          This input values in this section with nickname, user name, and real name 
          should be obvious to anyone familiar with using IRC.
        </p>
        <p>
          The &quot;altNick&quot; field is used when the primary nickname is unavailable.
          When &quot;recoverNick&quot; is set to true, automatic recovery of 
          the primary nickname will be attempted when the primary nickname becomes available.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case where an IRC server returns a 433 ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE
          prior to nickname registration, the altNick value will be 
          submitted as an alternate nickname. If recoverNick is set to true, 
          the automatic nickname recovery process will be activated by the 433 message.
          The &quot;nickRecoveryActive&quot; property in the irc state object will be set
          to true so the web browser can update status icons accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case where an IRC server returns a 432 ERR_ERRONEUSNICKNAME
          prior to nickname registration, the altNick value will be 
          submitted as an alternate nickname. However, auto-recovery of the 
          primary nickname is not enabled.  This is because 432 is probably caused by
          a services/nickserv nickname lock, and manual user intervention 
          will most likely be needed to clear the 432 IRC server message.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon IRC disconnect, if the alternate nickname is in use at the time
          of disconnect, the requested nickname will revert back to the 
          primary nickname value. Next next connection event will therefore 
          use the primary nickname. If the use has entered an ad-hoc nickname value different
          from both the primary and alternate nicknames, the ad-hoc nickname 
          will persist after disconnect.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a special case for DALnet where the user's nickname may be forced
          to a value of &quot;Guest12345&quot; by services/nickserv.
          The numeric part shown here as 12345 is uniquely created and may be a different number.
          Unless the user's primary nickname has been set to Guest12345 in the 
          configuration, the Guest* nickname will revert to the primary nickname 
          after IRC server disconnect.
        </p>
        <p>
          If recoverNick is set to the true, the client will automatically 
          attempt to recover the primary nickname by sending a NICK command
          with the primary nickname. This is triggered in 2 ways.
          If a ghost user with primary nickname is present in an IRC channel
          with the active alternate nickname, a QUIT message will trigger immediate
          nickname recovery. Otherwise, a cycle timer will periodically 
          attempt to send NICK commands with the primary nickname 
          until a time limit is reached. The duration between attempts 
          increases over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The automatic recovery of a nickname can be cancelled at any time
          by using the /NICK command to change nicknames.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that different types of IRC servers have different
          requirements for the number of characters allowed in a Nickname,
          user or real name. These are often displayed in a server message
          when you first connect to IRC. At the present time, the maximum
          length of these values is not checked by this program, so exceeding the limit
          set by the server would generate an IRC server error.
        </p>

        <div class="install-section-title">5 - Favorite channels</div>
        <p>
          At this time, the program does not auto-join of IRC #channels on startup.
          This may be added in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          The &quot;channelList&quot; property is used to designate a javascript array
          of string entries, where each array value is the name of an IRC channel.
          After connection to an IRC server, the favorite channels are
          displayed as buttons to allow easy /JOIN capability when using a
          smartphone.
          The array may be empty, but it must exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the IRC server auto-reconnect is enabled as discussed below, then upon
          a successful re-connect to the irc server, up to 5 irc channels
          will be automatically rejoined. The IRC channels eligible to be automatically 
          rejoined is based on channels open at the time of disconnect. 
          Automatic rejoin of channels has no relationship to the defined channelList array.

        <div class="install-section-title">6 - NickServ IDENTIFY</div>
        <p>
          There is a provision to automatically dispatch a NickServ IDENTIFY message.
          This enabled when the IRC configured primary nickname matches the 
          property &quot;identifyNick&quot; and both identifyNick and identifyCommand 
          properties are strings of length greater than zero. This feature is disabled by clearing either 
          or both of the properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Triggers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Prior to nickname registration, the nickserv IDENTIFY command is
            triggered upon receiving an IRC server &quot;001&quot; RPL_WELCOME message.
          </li>
          <li>
            During nickname recovery, the nickserv IDENTIFY command is 
            triggered upon server &quot;NICK&quot; message with proper nickname values.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Security Note: the optional identify command may contain passwords.
          This configuration is stored unencrypted in clear text in the servers.json file.
          It is recommended to check for proper file permissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          To disable this feature, set the following properties
          to be zero length strings.
        </p>
<div class="pre-div"><pre>
  "identifyNick": "",
  "identifyCommand": "",
</pre></div>
      <p>
        Please read this section carefully. This &quotidentifyCommand&quot property
        represents a <yellow-example>raw IRC command, not a private message</yellow-example>.
        This allows identification with IRC servers where
        &quot;NICKSERV&quot; and &quot;NS&quot; are valid IRC server commands and
        understood by NickServ network services.
        In cases where the identification must be sent by private message (/msg), then
        the proper private message raw command must be constructed with valid syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        If NickServ services requires a simple private message then the PRIVMSG
        raw server command would be used. The format of the entire message starts
        with the command &quot;PRIVMSG&quot;, followed by a space, followed by
        the IRC nickname of the recipient, followed by a space. The the
        message delimiter is a colon character &quot:&quot which is then followed
        with the private message contents. To identify in this manner using
        the password xxxxxxxx to identify your nickname MyNickname,
        the configuration would be set as shown in the next example.
        Note the colon character prefixing :IDENTIFY

      </p>
<div class="pre-div"><pre>
  "identifyNick": "MyNickname",
  "identifyCommand": "PRIVMSG NickServ :IDENTIFY xxxxxxxx",
</pre></div>
      <p>
        In the case where services have non-spoofable nicknames, the recipient
        of the private message would be modified as shown in the next example.
        Note the colon character prefixing :IDENTIFY
      </p>
<div class="pre-div"><pre>
  "identifyNick": "MyNickname",
  "identifyCommand": "PRIVMSG NickServ@services.dal.net :IDENTIFY xxxxxxxx",
</pre></div>
      <p>
        In the case where an IRC network has reserved &quot;NICKSERV&quot; as
        a custom IRC command you can use the next method. It reduces the
        risk of sending your IDENTIFY password to another user pretending
        to be nickserv. In this case, IDENTIFY and the password are sent as
        command parameters, so the colon is not required.
      </p>
<div class="pre-div"><pre>
  "identifyNick": "MyNickname",
  "identifyCommand": "NICKSERV IDENTIFY xxxxxxxx",
</pre></div>


<h2>Global Configuration</h2>

        <div class="install-section-title">configVersion (Global)</div>
        <p>
          The property &quot;configVersion&quot; is intended to throw a JavaScript 
          error on the NodeJs web server when the format version does not match the expected value.
          The expected value is currently 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upgrade Notes: For upgrade from 0.1.44 to 0.2.x perform the following changes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Set property &quot;configVersion&quot; to 2</li>
          <li>Remove property ircAutoReconnect (if you don't, the property is ignored)</li>
          <li>Remove property rawMessageLog (if you don't, the property is ignored)</li>
          <li>
            For each server definition, 4 new properties are required: disabled, proxy, reconnect, and logging.
            The simplest way to do this is to open each server using the server list editor web page
            to review each server definition, then save the entry. Alternately, the properties can be added manually
            to the servers.json file.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="install-section-title">CTCP Time Locale (global)</div>
        <p>
          The &quot;ctcpTimeLocale&quot; property is optional. It may be used
          to specify a CTCP TIME reply format.
          It may be used in the case where a client time zone when different
          from the server.
          This is used by native JavaScript toLocaleString() function.
          Caution, the toLocaleString() is implementation dependant, and
          this was written using Debian 10.
          The value is an array. The first element is the toLocaleString() locales string.
          The default locales string is &quot;en.US&quot;. The second element
          is used by the timeZone property of toLocaleString options parameter. The
          default value is &quot;UTC&quot;. It may be set to a different
          locale value such as "America/Chicago".
        </p>
