          Irc-hybrid-client is an IRC web client that uses a JavaScript frontend and Node.js/Express backend.
        </p>
        <p>
          The irc-hybrid-client supports both a light mode and dark mode. 
          This page was done with a black background to better show the screen capture images
          using the dark mode color scheme. The other pages are light background to 
          match various diagrams in the help pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The development and debugging were done using an iPhone and IOS Chrome Browser.
          The examples on this page are limited to mobile phone screen shots. However,
          the IRC client also works well using Chrome desktop browser on Linux. The desktop
          and mobile browser can be opened concurrently and will remain in sync.
        </p>

              After cloning the git repository, installing npm dependencies, and
              editing the configuration files as described in the
              <a href="installation.html">installation</a> section,
              a single user private web server can be deployed in a Linux shell.
            </p><p>
              Using a smartphone, laptop, or full size desktop display you can enter your web server
              login credentials to gain access to your private IRC client web server.

              The green [Web] icon at the top indicates that your browser is
              successfully connected to the backend web server.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this application, the web server manages
              the IRC server connection independently of the
              web browser. In this type of hybrid client, if
              you are temporarily disconnected, such as the smartphone
              screen lock, your nickname will remain present on IRC.
              The red [IRC] icon indicates you are disconnected from the IRC network.
            </p>
            <p>
              The IRC Controls panel will show information to identify the currently
              selected IRC server configuration.
              Press the [Connect] button to instruct the backend web server 
              to make a connection to the IRC network. If desired, an 
              alternate nickname may be specified for this connection.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Server List panel and the IRC Server edit form panel are explained
              with screen captures and instructions in 
              the <a href="server-config.html">IRC Config</a> page of the /docs/.

              A yellow [IRC] icon indicates a connection request is in progress.
              The [IRC] icon will change to green to indicate that the backend web
              server is logged into the IRC network.
              The IRC Server panel may open briefly to display IRC connection 
              status, but it will close when IRC connects.
            </p>
              The Join IRC Channels panel contains configurable buttons
              used to /JOIN IRC channels what were configured in the IRC server configuration.
              In this case, the &quot;#myChannel&quot; button will be clicked to 
              join the #myChannel IRC channel.
            <p>
              On this panel, the (0) icon at the top indicates the number of active IRC 
              channel panels. Other IRC channel names may be entered ad-hoc in the input field
              to the left of the [Join Channel] button.
            </p><p>
              At the bottom of the panel, check boxes indicate if new channel panels should be created 
              with audio beep sounds enabled by default. The beep sounds are configurable 
              in each channel.
            </p><p>
              By default, hidden channel panels will auto-open themselves when a new nickname 
              joins, the channel mode changes, or a new channel message is received.
              The auto-open feature of hidden panels may disabled as the default when 
              creating new channels. This is configurable in each channel.
              Channels displayed as a collapsed bar will not auto-open, only hidden panels.

              This screen capture image shows an IRC Channel panel viewed as it would look on an iPhone 
              in vertical orientation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The channel name and topic are displayed at the top of the channel window.
              The circle icon with transparent background and 
              digit (2) indicates there are 2 people present in the channel.
              The circle icon with solid background and digit (1) indicates 1 unread message has been 
              received in the channel while the channel panel was not the active panel.
              Below the title is a scrollable list of nicknames showing users present in the channel,
              followed by a scrollable text area where channel messages are displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Multiple panels may be open simultaneously for different IRC channels.
              Multiple panels may be scrolled vertically. Each panel may be
              hidden from view using the [X] icon in the upper left.
              Next to this is a button with two arrows, one up and one down, 
              which is used to collapse the channel panel to a bar.
            </p>
            <p>
              The [Leave] button is used to issue a &quot;/PART&quot; command to leave the IRC channel.
              After leaving a new [JOIN] will become visible which may be used to re-enter the IRC channel.
              If there is no intention to return, a [Prune] button will become visible and it may be clicked to 
              remove the panel and purge all channel related content from the message cache.
            </p>
            <p>
              Should your nickname be kicked from the IRC channel, a colored &quot;Kicked&quot; icon will 
              appear at the top of the channel panel. A Join button will be displayed 
              on the channel panel which may be used to rejoin the channel, unless banned.

              Clicking the text input area on an iPhone will trigger the phone to 
              open a touch keyboard. The IRC Channel panel will scroll upwards to 
              make room for the keyboard.
              On an iPhone, the microphone button on the Apple touch keyboard 
              may be used to engage the phone voice to text features.
              The send button is useful during voice dictation, but 
              pressing [Enter] or [Return] will also send messages.
            </p>
            <p>
              A primitive auto-complete function has been added to the channel window that will
              include channel name and nicknames present on the channel list.
              The auto-complete trigger is tab character, or double space
              (space-space) on mobile devices. Double tab or triple space fills channel name.
            </p>
            <p>
              Multi-line clipboard content can be sent. Paste the clipboard into the input 
              area. A confirming dialog will open where you can press a button labeled [Send as multi-line].
              This will send 1 line each 2 seconds up to 100 lines.

              Pressing the [Zoom] button in the upper right of the channel window
              will select channel zoom mode.
            </p>
            <p>
              Zoom mode will hide all other panels.
            </p>
            <p>  
              The number of columns and rows in the 
              textarea elements will be adjusted to allow the channel panel 
              to fill the screen. However, dynamic resizing is disabled during zoom due to 
              conflicts with the popup touch keyboard. If the browser size is changed on the 
              desktop while zoomed, un-zoom, then re-zoom again to fit the page. 
              When not zoomed, all panels will auto-resize dynamically as needed. 
            </p>
            <p>
              If the screen width is below a minimum value, the nickname list 
              is also hidden in zoom mode. To view the nickname list, unzoom, the re-zoom the panel.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a channel window is in zoom mode, all other channel panels 
              and private message panels are blocked from opening while zoom is active. 
              Icons in the header bar will indicate the presence of unread messages in other 
              panels as described further on at the bottom of this help page.
              Manually opening any other panel will cancel the zoom.
            </p>
            <p>
              When in zoom mode, a [Zoom] icon will appear in the header bar at the top of the page.
              Clicking the [Zoom] icon in the header bar will also cancel the zoom.

              Clicking the button with the double up/down arrows will

            <p>
              The Inhibit-auto-scroll checkbox, when checked, will temporarily prevent
              the textarea element from auto-scrolling when a new message arrives.
              The intent of auto-scroll is position the most recent 
              message to the bottom so it will be visible.
              However, auto-scrolling clears text highlighting, and this makes copying text 
              or URL to the clipboard almost impossible during a busy conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The brief checkbox changes the text format so that the message 
              timestamp and nickname will be positioned on separate lines separated by a space.
              When not selected, each message will be a single line of text as shown in the next screen capture 
              immediately below. This is intended for use on a larger display, such as a desktop monitor.
            </p>
            <p>
              The auto-complete can be disabled if it is conflicting with the user input, such as 
              entering multiple space characters intentionally.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 3 checkboxes at the bottom will enable the browser to play a brief audio &quot;beep&quot;
              sound when a new message arrives, a new person joins the IRC channel, or your 
              current nickname is mentioned in conversation.
              There are instruction for configuration of custom sounds in the
              <a href="login-config.html">Login Config</a> section.
            </p>
            <p>
              By default, hidden channel panels will auto-open when a new nickname 
              joins, the channel mode changes, or a new channel message is received.
              Three checkboxes may be used to disable auto-open of hidden panels.

              The application is also capable of exchanging private messages with
              other users.
              A separate window is used for each separate private message nickname.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this case, the (P) icon in the header bar shows an unread message has arrived.
              The circle icon with solid background and number (1) indicates 1 unread message has been received
              in the private message panel when the panel was not the active panel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Private message panels will remain active as long as the corresponding 
              messages are present in the message cache.
              The double arrow button may be used to expose additional private message 
              settings where a [Erase All PM Panels] button can clear the cache.
              Clearing the cache will remove all private message panels and their messages.

              Hidden panels will open and scroll into position when channel events occur.              
              This behavior is summarized in the help panel.
              Hidden panels may be inhibited from auto-open using checkboxes in the 
              bottom section of the channel panel.

              New private message conversations can be initiated using the 
              Private Message panel which can be opened from the dropdown 
              menu or by using the Alt-P HotKey.
              From this panel, the recipient nickname and private message text can be entered. 
              Upon submitting the message a new private message panel will be created.
              Optionally, there is a /WHOIS button that can be optionally used to 
              check if the recipient is online in the IRC network before sending the message.

              The round circle icon with transparent background show here with &quot;0&quot; indicates the count 
              of active private message panels. In this case it is zero because 
              no panels have been created yet. If there are any unread private messages, 
              a second circle icon will appear with a solid background indicating 
              the sum all all unread private messages over all private message panels.

              The IRC Server panel may be used to view IRC server messages. 
              User generated channel messages and private messages will 
              have been removed by filters and they are not shown on  this panel.
              The IRC server panel may be opened from the dropdown menu, 
              the Alt-S HotKey, or the (S) activity icon in the header bar.
            </p>
            <p>
              A limited set of IRC text commands are supported.
              Text commands start with a slash / character.
              The channel panel and private message panels also support 
              IRC text commands.
              The help panel (Alt-H) includes a list of supported IRC text commands.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this example, the IRC command &quot;/MOTD&quot; was sent to the IRC server 
              and the panel shows the IRC server's &quot;Message of the day&quot; response.
            </p>
            <p>
              Buttons marked [Refresh] are located on several panels.
              The refresh feature will refresh all panels from an IRC
              message buffer stored in the web server. The cache is
              currently 100 IRC server messages per IRC channel up to 5 channels,
              and 100 private message (PM) messages total for all active PM.

              The message buffer is primarily intended to refresh after short disconnects,
              such as smartphone screen lock. Refreshing after
              a longer period of time may cause the cache buffer
              to exceed size limit and some older messages may be discarded.
            </p>
            <p>
              The IRC &quot;Lag&quot; times displayed here represent PING measurements
              between the remote IRC client, located inside the web server, and the remote 
              IRC server. Packet delay between the web browser and web server would not 
              be included in this time measurement.

            When opening a web page, for security and privacy reasons, the browser will disable playing of media content
            until the user takes an intentional action, such as clicking a &quot;Play&quot; button.
            In the case where audio beep sounds are enabled, the Un-Mute button must be clicked to 
            provide a user initiated action to enable playing of media in the browser.
            Typically, refreshing the page in Chrome will require Un-Mute.

              The spinner will be hidden when all concurrent HTTP requests are complete.
              The IRC network returning text based messages return over a different channel using a socket
