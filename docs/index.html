          Irc-hybrid-client is an IRC web client that uses a JavaScript frontend and Node.js/Express backend.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is still under development and new features may be added in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          The development and debugging were done using an iPhone and IOS Chrome Browser.
          The examples on this page are limited to mobile phone screen shots. However,
          the IRC client also works well using Chrome desktop browser on Linux. The desktop
          and mobile browser can be opened concurrently and will remain in sync.
        </p>

              After cloning the git repository, installing npm dependencies, and
              editing the configuration files as described in the
              <a href="installation.html">installation</a> section,
              a single user private web server can be deployed in a Linux shell.
            </p><p>
              Using an smartphone, you can enter your web server
              login credentials to gain access to your private IRC client web server.

            <p>
              The green [Web] icon at the top indicates that your browser is
              successfully connected to the backend web server.
              You should see familiar IRC configuration settings 
              showing your IRC nickname.
            </p><p>
              In this application, the web server manages
              the IRC server connection independently of the
              web browser. In this type of hybrid client, if
              you are temporarily disconnected, such as the smartphone
              screen lock, your nickname will remain present on IRC.
            </p><p>
              The web server maintains a predefined list of IRC servers.
              A server list editor is available by pressing the <div Edit="" Server="" List=""></div> button.
              This will open an independent web page that can be used to create, 
              modify, or delete IRC server definitions from the list. 
              These are described in the <a href="server-config.html">Server-config</a> tab.
            </p><p>
              The [Next] and [Prev] buttons are used to cycle through the 
              list of available IRC server definitions.
            </p><p>
              After selecting a server, the next step is to connect to IRC with 
              your nickname using either the [Connect-IRC] button or 
              you can tap on the red [IRC] status icon at the top.

              A yellow [IRC] icon indicates the connection process is in progress.
              The [IRC] icon will change to green to indicate that the backend web
              server is logged into the IRC network.
            </p>
            <p>
              Up on successful connection to the IRC server, a lot of content
              will scroll within the server window.
              This includes information about the server and the IRC server message
              of the day (motd).
            </p>
            <p>
              At any time you can disconnect from the IRC server by tapping the
              green [IRC] status indicator at the top.  You can also disconnect
              from the web page, leaving your nickname present on IRC by
              tapping the green [Web] icon at the top.

              The user interface for this program is divided into
              collapsible sections that can be expanded with the [+]
              buttons located on the left. The interface can be returned
              to this configuration with all sections collapsed by tapping the [-all]
              button in the status bar at the top.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this case, server window was closed with the [-] Server button.
            </p>
            <p>
              The green window at the bottom is where you can join IRC channels.
              If you defined some favorite IRC channel names in the configuration
              file, buttons will be added to allow easy navigation
              to join channels while using a smartphone. In this example
              we will tap the "#myChannel" button.

              The channel name and topic are displayed at the top of the channel window.
              The green icon with the digit (2) indicates there are 2 people present in the channel.
              The white icon with the digit (1) indicates 1 unread message has been received in the channel.
              Below the title is a list of nicknames for users present in the channel,
              followed by a text area where messages are displayed.
            </p><p>
              Text messages can be entered using a keyboard, smartphone popup text editor
              or using smartphone voice dictation. The send button is useful during
              voice dictation, but pressing [Enter] or [Return] will also send messages.
            </p><p>
              A primitive auto-complete function has been added to the channel window that will
              include channel name and nicknames present on the channel list.
              The auto-complete trigger is tab character, or double space
              (space-space) on mobile devices. Double tab or triple space fills channel name.
            </p><p>
              Checkboxes can be selected to enable an audible beep tone to
              trigger when messages are typed in the channel, or when your
              nickname is mentioned on the channel. Custom audio file selection is
              not available.

              Pressing the [Zoom] button in the upper right of the channel window
              will select channel zoom mode.
            </p>
            <p>
              Zoom mode will collapse all other windows.

            <p>
              While in channel zoom mode, the buttons and checkboxes at the
              bottom of the channel window will be hidden.
              If the screen width is below a minimum value, the nickname list is also hidden.
              The hidden items can be toggled to visible by clicking the [Zoom] / [No Zoom] button.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this case there are no unread messages so 
              the white unread message icon has been removed from the channel window.

              When the smartphone is flipped on it's side, the screen layout
              will adapt to the new screen width.
              In this case the channel is still enabled.

              There are two different text format schemes that are selected
              automatically when the page loads. These can be toggled at any
              time by selecting the checkbox marked: [X] Brief.
              The Brief checkbox is not visible here because the Zoom was enabled.

            </p>
            <p>
              A limited set of IRC text commands are supported.
              Text commands start with a slash / character and
              text commands can be entered in any of the windows.
              If you scroll to the top, the Info/License window
              includes a list of supported IRC text commands.

            <p>
              Buttons marked [Refresh] are located on several windows.
              The refresh feature will refresh all windows from a
              message buffer stored in the web server. The cache is
              currently 100 IRC server messages per IRC channel up to 5 channels.
              The message buffer is primarily intended to refresh after short disconnects,
              such as smartphone screen lock. Refreshing after
              a longer period of time may cause the cache buffer
              to exceed size limit and some older messages may be discarded.
