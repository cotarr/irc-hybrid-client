          Irc-hybrid-client is an IRC web client that uses a JavaScript frontend and Node.js/Express backend.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is still under development and changes frequently.
        </p>

              After cloning the git repository, installing npm dependencies, and
              editing the configuration files as described in the
              <a href="installation.html">installation</a> section,
              a single user web server can be deployed in a Linux shell.
            </p><p>
              Using an smartphone, you can enter your web server
              login credentials to gain access to your private IRC client web server.
            </p>

          <div class="image-text">
            <p>
              The green [web] icon at the top indicates that your browser is
              successfully connected to the backend web server.
              You should see a familiar IRC configuration form
              where you can enter your preferred Nickname.
            </p><p>
              In this application, the backend web server manages
              the IRC server connection independently of the
              web browser. In this type of hybrid client, if
              you are temporarily disconnected, such as the smartphone
              screen lock, your nickname will remain present on IRC.
            </p><p>
              At this time, the IRC server address and port
              information are defined in editable configuration text files
              located on the web server. The IRC server and port should
              be set before starting the server. The [Next Server]
              button can be used to select between multiple servers
              that are defined in the configuration file.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, you can connect to IRC with your nickname using either
              the [Connect-IRC] button or you can tap on the red [IRC] status icon at the top.
            </p>

              The green [IRC] icon indicates that the backend web
              server is logged into the IRC network.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user interface for this program is divided into
              collapsible sections that can be expanded with the [+]
              buttons located on the left. The interface can be returned
              to this configuration with all sections collapsed by tapping the [-all]
              button in the status bar at the top.
            </p>
            <p>
              At any time you can disconnect from the IRC server by tapping the
              green [IRC] status indicator at the top.  You can also disconnect
              from the web page, leaving your nickname present on IRC by
              tapping the green [Web] icon at the top.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you defined some favorite IRC channel names in the configuration
              file, buttons will be added to allow easy navigation
              to join channels while using a smartphone. In this example
              we will tap the "#mychannel" button.
            </p>

            </p><p>
              The channel name and topic are displayed at the top of the channel window.
              Below the title is a list of nicknames for users present in the channel,
              followed by a text area where messages are displayed.
            </p><p>
              Text messages can be entered using a keyboard, smartphone popup text editor
              or using smartphone voice dictation. The send button is useful during
              voice dictation, but pressing [Enter] or [Return] will also send messages.
            </p><p>
              A primitive auto-complete function has been added to the channel window that will
              include channel name and nicknames pressent on the channel list.
              The auto-complete trigger is double-space. Auto-complete is only
              available in channel windows.
            </p><p>
              Checkboxes can be selected to enable an audible beep tone to
              trigger when messages are typed in the channel, or when your
              nickname is mentioned on the channel. Custom audio file selection is
              not available.

              When the smartphone is flipped on it's side, the screen layout
              will adapt to the new screen width.

              There are two different text format schemes that are selected
              automatically when the page loads. These can be toggled at any
              by selecting the [X] Brief checkbox.

              The horizontal phone position is also a good way to view
              server messages that are sent by the IRC server.
            </p>
            <p>
              A limited set of IRC text commands are supported.
              Text commands start with a slash / character and
              text commands can be entered in any of the windows.
            </p>
            <p>
              Buttons marked [Refresh] are located on several windows.
              The refresh feature will refresh all windows from a
              message buffer stored in the web server. The cache is
              currently 100 server messages. The message buffer is
              primarily intended to refresh after short disconnects,
              such as smartphone screen lock. Refreshing after
              a longer period of time may cause the cache buffer
              to exceed 100 messages and the oldest messages, possible
              in other windows, may be discarded.

              The application is also capable of exchanging private messages with
              other users.
              A separate window is used for each separate nickname.

              The status bar at the top will display various status icons
              to show the status of the program. In this case the green [Web] icon
              indicates the web server is connected. The [Web] icon can be tapped
              as an alternate way to connect and disconnect the browser.
              The green [IRC] icon indicates the IRC server is also connected.
