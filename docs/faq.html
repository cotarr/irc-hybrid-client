              Q: Why did you write this program?<br>
            </p>
            A: That's a good question. There are already many excellent IRC clients to choose
            from. Why write my own? Actually, I ran across a youtube video where a simple telnet
            client was easily able to emulate an IRC client. I loaded an
            ngircd IRC server into a Raspberry Pi, and I started to explore
            while reading the RFC-2812 client protocol. I soon found
            telnet very repetitious, so I opened nodejs and with a little
            Googling, I had a socket connecting to IRC and exchanging
            messages with the server.
            <br><br>
            Previously I have tried several options to use IRC on my iPhone.
            I really didn't like any of them. Given the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown,
            I've been primarily stuck at home with nothing to do. Over the
            period of about a month, this slowly evolved into hybrid IRC web client
            paired up with a nodejs backend. Despite the limited functionality
            compared to a full IRC client, I found that I enjoyed the way it worked
            on my mobile phone. From there, it slowly began to evolve as I used it.

              Q: What difficult challenges did you face?<br>
            </p>
            A: I found it challenging to work with sockets. I used the npm package "ws"
            as a websocket server for the browser connection, and nodejs API net.Socket or tls.TLSSocket
            to connect to IRC.
            Addressing tasks like wrapping the websocket in TLS,
            security authorization of the browser's websocket connection,
            detecting desconnects, and dealing with legacy disconnected sockets
            was an interesting learning experience.
            <br><br>
            I also found it tricky to encode and decode buffers of multi-byte international
            characters where a string byte length is different from the string character length.
            Then, from a stream/message standpoint, multiple messages from the server can
            concatenate into a single socket data packet, or
            one individual IRC message can split between two differnt data packets, requiring
            re-assembly into a single string.

            <p>
              Q: Are multiple users supported?<br>
            </p>
            A: No. This operates as a single user personal server.
            One person per webserver instance.

          <tr><td><a name="multinet">
            <p>
              Q: Are multiple IRC networks supported?<br>
            </p>
            A: No. The application is limited to one IRC network connection at a time.
            You can sign out of IRC and switch between different IRC networks using the [Next] button.

            <p>
              Q: Are concurrent connections supported?<br>
            </p>
            A: Yes. A desktop, tablet, and smartphone can be open at the same time.
            Each device will remain in sync, showing the same content in all devices concurrently.

              Q: Does the program use cookies?<br>
            </p>
            A: Yes. During normal use web browser http requests are
            authroized using session cookies for purposes of access control.
            This is disclosed on the login form. No additional persistent
            identifiers are used.
