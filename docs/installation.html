          Installation
        </div>
        <p>
          If you are familiar with the process of cloning a Node.js/Exress
          git repository, you can use abbreviated instructions in the README.md
          file in the github repository.
        </p>


        <div class="install-section-title">Project Status (Work in Progress)</div>
        <p>
          This project is still under development and changes frequently.
          At this time, no formal release has been issued.
        </p>

        <div class="install-section-title">Prerequisite Knowledge</div>
        <p>
          In order to you this software it is necessary to install
          and run a Node.js web server on a Linux system.
          In general, this will involve the following prerequisite knowledge.
        </p>
        <ul class="install-list">
          <li>Comfortable using ssh and command line interface (CLI)</li>
          <li>Use of git to clone a git repository using CLI</li>
          <li>Use of Node.js package manager npm to install dependencies</li>
          <li>Use of text editor to modify raw JSON configuration files</li>
          <li>Experience opening firewall ports to expose a server</li>
          <li>Experience generating web server TLS certificates</li>
          <li>Familiar with IRC and with configuration of IRC clients</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="install-section-title">System Requirements (Server)</div>
        <p>
          No formal security evaluation has been performed.
          As a security consideration, it is recommended to run the web
          server in a non-privileged shell without root access.
          It does not require a privileged port less than 1024,
          however you must choose a port not blocked by your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the server is internet facing, it is recommended to configure
          the server to use TLS certificates to protect passwords using
          SSL/TLS encryption.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application was developed in a virtual machine running
          Debian-10. The author deploys it for personal use in a
          cloud VPS single-core droplet with 500MB RAM running Debian 10.
          It has also run during debugging on a RaspberryPi 3 and 4
          behind a NAT router.
        </p>
        <p>
          The program has run without errors under Node.js versions 12 and 14
          and npm version 7.
          Other versions of Node.js have not been tried.
        </p>
        <div class="install-section-title">System Requirements (Browser)</div>
        <p>
          This HTML, CSS and browser JavaScript was written and debugged
          using the Chrome web browser running under Linux, and using
          the mobile Chrome browser on an Apple iPhone 8 Plus.
          No other browsers besides Chrome have been tested.
        </p>
        <div class="install-section-title">Other Requriements (IRC network)</div>
        <p>
          The IRC interface was primarily developed and tested using the DALnet
          IRC network. Local testing was performed using ngirc-25 from the
          Debian apt package. Other IRC servers have not been tested.
          RFC-2812 "Internet Relay Chat: Client Protocol" was the primary
          specification reference. Considering this is a limited functionality
          mobile phone client, not all IRC features have been implemented.
        </p>
        <div class="install-section-title">1 - Install Node.js</div>
        <p>
          Node.js is a JavaScript interpreter that can execute JavaScript programs
          from a Linux terminal.
          It is similar to using python, and it includes a package manager, npm,
          similar to using pip in python.
          Some web developers prefer node, becasue their JavaScript programming
          knowledge can be used for coding both browser and backend web server
          using the JavaScript language.
          You can check if nodejs is installed by typing
          &quotnode -v&quot
          in your terminal. If installed, the version will be displayed.
          If node is not installed, there are several options:
        </p>
        <p>
          To install Node.js, one option is to visit the Node.js website at
          <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">https://nodejs.org/en/</a>
          where you can download a tar file and compile node from source.
          The second alternatvie is to use pre-compiled binaries
          for Linux that are available from
          <a href="https://github.com/nodesource/distributions">https://github.com/nodesource/distributions</a>.
          Both of these include installation instructions.
          Depending on your version of Linux, &quotnodejs&quot and &quotnpm&quot may be available
          as system packages in your Linux distribution, but these may be older versions.
        </p>
        <div class="install-section-title">2 - Clone github repository</div>
        <p>
          The next step is to clone the github repository. Typing the following
          command will install the repository as a folder in the current working directory.
          Change directory to that folder.
        </p>

<div class="pre-div"><pre>
git clone https://github.com/cotarr/irc-hybrid-client.git
cd irc-hybrid-client
</pre></div>

        <div class="install-section-title">3 - Install package dependencies</div>
        <p>
          This program uses the Express web server framework.
          The Express web site is located at
          <a href="https://expressjs.com/">https://expressjs.com/</a>.
          Express framework and various JavaScript dependency libraries
          will be installed using the npm package manager.
        </p>
        <p>
          The npm package manager library dependencies are specified in the file &quotpackage.json&quot.
          The dependencies will managed by npm and placed in a folder named &quotnode_modules&quot.
          Prior to installing dependencies, the environment variable &quotNODE_ENV&QUOT
          should be set to select which dependencies should be included and how
          program output should be logged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Select only 1 of the following 2 options.
        </p>
<div class="pre-div"><pre>
# Option 1 Run local to try it out. (development --> log to console)
export NODE_ENV=development
npm install

# Option 2 Typical for server installation, use minified files, log output to files.
# ci = clean install
export NODE_ENV=production
npm ci
</pre></div>

        <div class="install-section-title">4 - TLS Certificates</div>
        <p>
          It is a good practice to use TLS for both the IRC server
          connection and the browser. The certificates will provide
          some verification that you are connecting to the intended
          server, avoiding a man in the middle interception.
        </p>
        <p>
          Managing TLS certificates is a complex task, mostly beyond
          the scope of these instructions. However some simple guidance may
          point your in the right direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the IRC server connection, typically port 6697 for TLS,
          node uses the openssl and certificates
          in the Linux operating system, and no special configuration
          should be required to support TLS, provided that nodejs and your system
          were compiled with the current version of openssl.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the browser to connect, as with any webserver,
          use of TLS requires a registered domain name
          and server TLS certificates that have been signed by a
          recognized certificate authority. I use the LetsEncrypt certbot.
          Debian includes certbot as an apt package. Assuming you have a domain
          name, the following command would generate a set of certificates
          good for 90 days. Be sure to switch example.com with your domain name.
        </p>
<div class="pre-div"><pre>
# Make sure no other programs are listening on ports 80, 443
# Temporarily open firewall ports 80, 443
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d abcd.example.com
</pre></div>
        <p>
          Since it is recommended to run this program in a non-privledged
          account using non-privledged ports, it may be necessary to make
          a copy of privkey.pem and fullchain.pem to a local folder
          where the web server will have read access. It is NOT recommended
          to run the IRC client as root, simply for certificate access.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a more experienced user and prefer to generate self
          signed certificates and install your self signed CA into the browser,
          that approach would work, but it is beyond the scope of these instructions.
          However, if your intention is to use a smartphone IRC client,
          a valid domain name with server certificates generally what
          a smartphone operating system and browser would expect.
        </p>

        <div class="install-section-title">5 - Configuration Files</div>
        <p>
          There are two example configuration files that need to be
          copied to new filenames. They require editing before use.
          The web server reads configuration from these files when the server starts.
          A utililty program is included to assign the web page login password.
          Two other sections of this web page contain detail instructions describing
          how to edit the configuration, so it will not be repeated here.
        </p>
        <p>
          4A Edit: credentials.json (<a href="login-config.html">Login Config Instructions</a>),
          <br>
          4B Edit: servers.json (<a href="server-config.html">IRC Config Instructions</a>)
        </p>


        <div class="install-section-title">6 - Firewall configuration</div>
        <p>
          It is assumed you are generally familiar with configuration
          of firewall ports. There are two connections that must
          cross the firewall, one to the IRC server, and one
          to the browser.
        </p>
<pre>
             Firewall               Firewall
                 |                      |
   Browser ------|----- webserver ------|------IRC-server
                 |                      |
</pre>
        <p>
          For the IRC server, the backend web server will
          establish an outgoing connection request to the IRC server,
          such as port 6667 non-encrypted or 6697 for TLS encrypted.
          Once established, this socket is kept open continuously for
          asynchronous communications with the IRC server.
          Your firewall should allow outgoing connection
          to the TCP port listed in the IRC server configuration.
          In most cases, outbound connections are not restricted,
          so this may not require any special filter rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your server is running an identd daemon to listen on port 113, this
          would be outside the scope of these instructions. This is really
          separate from the IRC client.
        </p>
        <p>
          The firewall must configure one TCP port for incoming connections
          from the web browser.
          This incoming port is used two ways.
          It is used for standard http GET or POST requests from the browser
          used to download the web page files and make API requests.
          The port is also used to establish and maintain a websocket connection
          so the browser can pass IRC messages asynchronously.
          One single TCP port is used for both.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you prefer to use restricted port 443 for your webserver, it would be recommended
          to place the IRC client on an alternate non-privileged port, then use
          iptables rules to exchange port numbers to 443 as packets cross the firewall.
          This will improve security by keeping the IRC client in a non-privledged account.
          It would be necessary to temporarily remove these iptables rules to
          use certbot to renew the TLS certificates.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, one inbound TCP connection and one outbound TCP connection are
          required to pass the firewall.
          There should be no other other network connections to this IRC client.
        </p>

        <div class="install-section-title">8 - File Permissions</div>
        <p>
          When running on a multi-user system, review directory or file permissions
          to properly protect configuration passwords and log files.
          When the program first starts, if not existing, it will create a
          &quotlogs&quot folder with 0o700 (drwx------) permissions.
          The &quotcredentials.json&quot and &quotservers.json&quot files
          are recommended to be 0o600 (drw-------).
        </p>

        <div class="install-section-title">9 - Log Files</div>
        <p>
          The current program does not manage, limit or prune log file size.
          If you use logging, monitor file size as necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the program first starts, if not existing, it will create a
          &quotlogs&quot folder. If you have enabled logging,
          the log files will be written to this folder in the current working directory.
          Configuration of a custom directory location is not supported in this version.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>auth.log - Web page user authentication.</li>

          <li>access.log - HTTP access requests.
          By default, the log is filtered to show only errors (http status code>= 400)
          This is configured in the morgan options.</li>

          <li>irc.log - This is a log of all IRC server messages in raw format.
          This can become quite large.
          It is primarily indended for debugging, and should probably be left disabled.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <div class="install-section-title">10 - Starting the server</div>
        <p>
          This assumes the initial setup configuration in the step 5 has been completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The web server will be started from the command line.
          It will remain in the foreground.
          If NODE_ENV is set to &quotdevelopment&quot, all of the
          log file output will be sent to the console terminal.
          If NODE_ENV is set to production, log file output will be
          sent to files located in the logs folder.
          Any javascript console.log output that will still go to the console terminal.
        </p>
        <p>
          While running in the foreground, the server can be stopped by
          typing ctrl-C in the terminal.
        </p>
        <p>
          While in the project directory, start the web server by typing:
        </p>
<div class="pre-div"><pre>
node bin/www
</pre></div>
        <p>
          To access the IRC client from your web browser, append the path
          <yellow-example>/irc/webclient.html</yellow-example> to the web server domain or IP address.
          You will be redirected to a login form for entry of the user and password
          created above.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several ways to
          run the server unattended in the background. One way is to
          append an &quot&amp&quot symbol to the end of the command line.
          An alternative method is to load the &quotscreen&quot
          program which allows Linux to run a detached command shell
          that can be reattached at a later time as a console terminal.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are running bash want to capture any console standard or error output while running in the background,
          you may redirect terminal output to a log file and
          launch to the program into the background by appending an &quot&amp&quot.
          Attempting this from a script or from cron may require full file pathnames.
          Systems may vary, but it would look something like this:
          &quotnode bin/www &amp>> logs/node.log &&quot
        </p>

        <div class="install-section-title">11 - Minify and bundle (Optional)</div>
        <p>
          This section is optional. This repository contains both minified and
          original un-minified files.
          The repository can be cloned and deployed &quotas-is&quot,
          requiring only editing of the configurations files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Running minify development tools will concatenate multiple web page
          files into one HTML, one JavaScript, and one CSS file.
          It will remove comments and whitespace from the javascript, html and css code.
          This will significantly reduce the download size of the files
          and reduce bandwidth used by smartphones.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case where the web page files have been edited, you may want
          to regenrate a new folder containing replacement minified files for the web page.
          The there is a separate repository for this called
          <a href="https://github.com/cotarr/irc-hybrid-client-dev-tools">irc-hybrid-client-dev-tools</a>.
          There are complete instructions for use of this utility in the
          <a href="https://github.com/cotarr/irc-hybrid-client-dev-tools">irc-hybrid-client-dev-tools</a>
          repository.
        </p>

        <div class="install-section-title">12 - Upgrade Procedure</div>
        <p>
          This upgrade procedure is for the case where the web server consistes of a
          cloned git repositiory, copied and edited configuration files, and
          packages installed with npm ci, then the web server can be upgraded by
          stopping the server, changing to the repository folder and typing the following:
