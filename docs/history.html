          Temporary fix for audio beeps in IRC channel blocked by browser policy.
          On page load, the browser may block the Audio.play() request pending user interaction.
          Added new button marked [+Audio] that will appear if the
          header bar when enabled audio media may be blocked by browser.
          Selecting buttion will manually play audio, which is detected by browser.
          This only applies to audio IRC channel beep tone checkboxes.
          This is an interim fix. A more elegant long term solution is needed.

            Storage of data in browser localStorage was added to the program.
            <br><br>
            The web userid and web login timestamp are saved to localStorage.
            The userid is an integer number starting at 1 that is assigned in the credentials.js file.
            The userid number is used to delete localStorage when a change in userid is detected.
            The string value of the username is not saved.
            <br><br>
            Recode the IRC channel zoom/unzoom view mode functionality.
            Channel zoom buttons always visible when window collapsed.
            When an IRC channel is placed into zoom view mode, the IRC channel name is
            saved to the browsers localStorage API.
            When zoom is cancelled, the localStorage channel name is removed.
            When opening the web page, if a previous zoom was active, the browser
            will open in IRC channel zoom mode.
            <br><br>The audio beep enable status for an IRC channel is saved to localStorage.
            When reloading the page, matching IRC channels will enable audio beep
            based on data from previous settings in browser localStorage.
